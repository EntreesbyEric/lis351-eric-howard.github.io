				<p> Madison, the capital of Wisconsin, was founded in 1836, 12 years before Wisconsin became a state.
					According to the 2020 census, Madison has a population of 269,840 making it the second largest city in Wisconsin. 
					Named after the late president James Madison, Madison is home to the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 
					The University of Wisconsin-Madison is the largest univeristy in the state of Wisconsin and is often viewed as 
					an "public ivy" for being a top-ranked instuition in public rankings and research. Geographically, Madison is built on 
					an isthmusâ€”a narrow strip of land connecting two larger areas with bodies of water on both sides. The two bodies of water are
					Lake Mendota, which is north of the isthmus, and Lake Monoma, which is southeast of the isthmus. Below, are some pictures that showcase
					some of Madison's iconic places. The picture from left to right are a view of the capitol over Monoma, the Memorial Terrace, and State Street.</p>
