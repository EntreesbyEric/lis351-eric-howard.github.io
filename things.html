		<article><p>As the second largest city in the state of Wisconsin by population, there are a plethora of things to do in state's capitol. The first thing that I recommend 
		every visitor to do is visit the Farmer's market on the Capitol square. On every non-home football weekend in the fall, the Capitol square hosts local farmers and vendors to gather around 
		on the Capitol square to sell their crops, products, and food. This is a great way to not only support local businesses and farmers but to see what neat things the Farmer's market has in store! I highly 
		recommend purchasing the famous jalapeno cheesy bread. Another thing to do in the Madison area is to visit the Memorial Union Terrace. The Memorial Union Terrace oversees Lake Mendota and one can often 
		see many people swimming, kayaking, and sailing in the summertime. Additionally, live music is provided in during the late afternoon in the summertime. So, take a seat back, relax and grab some beverages and 
		grub and enjoy the breeze from the lake. The last thing to do on this list, but certainly not the least is to visit the Olbrich Botanical Gardens. The Olbrich Botanical Gardens feature 16 acres of stunning 
		landscapes and Midwest-hardy plants. This place makes you feel one with nature and is very affordable to visit. There is also the Bolz Conservatory which offers a variety of tropical plants, exotic birds, and a waterfall. 
		Make sure to bring a friend and a camera to keep memories of the time you visited. </p></article>
