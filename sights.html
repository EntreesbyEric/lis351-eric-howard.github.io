		<article><p>While visiting Madison there are many sights to see, but many of them may not be known by the typical visitor. Here are my top three sights to see in Madison. The first sight to see in Madison 
		is Bascom Hill. Located at the opposite end of State Street, Bascom Hill serves as the only quad-style area on the UW-Madison campus. On Bascom Hill, you will find students and alumni alike reading and 
		relaxing in the warm weather. Bascom Hill hosts many buildings including the Law Building, Education Building, and Bascom Hall. So, be weary of the many students travelling up and down between classes as they 
		might trampel over you. The second sight to see is the Blue Mounds State Park. The Blue Mounds State Park is located just outside Madison, but it is worth the extra distance. Blue Mounds State Park offers spectacular views and 
		unique geological features. A swimming pool is available during summer. Over 20 miles of scenic hiking, off-road biking and cross-country ski trails, as well as a family campground, access to the Military Ridge State Trail 
		with bike-in campsites and a rustic cabin for people with disabilities make Blue Mound a popular destination year-round. The third and last sight to see in Madison is the State Capitol Building. The Wisconsin State Capitol, 
		located in Madison, Wisconsin, houses both chambers of the Wisconsin legislature along with the Wisconsin Supreme Court and the Office of the Governor. Completed in 1917, the building is the fifth to serve as the Wisconsin capitol 
		since the first territorial legislature convened in 1836 and the third building since Wisconsin was granted statehood in 1848. Be sure to take a tour of the inside, as it is very fascinating!</p></article>
